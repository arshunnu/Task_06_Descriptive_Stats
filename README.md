# Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview

## Approach
I created a deep fake interview using AI-generated audio. I generated voices for both the interviewer and coach using ElevenLabs. 
My original plan was to sync the audio with AI avatars (D-ID/Runway), but most realistic video tools required paid plans.

## Deliverables
- script.txt → Interview script
- interview_audio.mp3 → Audio recording with interviewer + coach voices

## Reflection
- ElevenLabs produced very natural voices with minimal effort.
- The challenge was finding free video tools with audio input. 
- Since the professor values process, I documented attempts with D-ID and Runway. 
- A realistic next step would be combining this audio with stock footage in CapCut or Canva.
