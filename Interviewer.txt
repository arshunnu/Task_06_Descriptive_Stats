Interviewer: "Welcome back, everyone. We're here today to talk about the 2025 SU women's lacrosse season, a year that certainly had its share of ups and downs. Coach, coming off a season with a final record of nine wins and six losses, what's your overall takeaway from the year?"

Coach: "I'm incredibly proud of this team and what they accomplished this season. While the record shows nine and six, what it doesn't show is the resilience and heart they demonstrated. We had some great moments and valuable learning experiences. It was a successful year of growth."

Interviewer: "The season had some incredible highs, including that strong finish with four straight wins. But it also had a tough stretch in the middle, including a three-game losing streak. What do you think contributed to that mid-season slump and how did the team manage to turn things around?"

Coach: "We definitely faced some adversity, but I think that's where we showed our true character. The team never quit. During that losing streak, we went back to basics, focused on our fundamentals, and came out stronger. That’s what allowed us to finish the regular season with four impressive wins against tough conference opponents. That kind of fight is what we'll build on for next year."

Interviewer: "You had some impressive wins against top opponents like Boston College and Virginia Tech, but also tough losses to teams like Northwestern and Maryland. How do you assess the team's performance against the most challenging competition?"

Coach: "We always want to measure ourselves against the best, and we got that opportunity this year. We started the season with a strong victory over a formidable Boston College team and had some great showings in other games. We know where we stand and what we need to work on. Every loss is a lesson, and we’ll use what we learned to come back even stronger."

Interviewer: "Finally, looking at the end of the season, the last two losses came in neutral-site games against Yale and Stony Brook. Can you speak to the challenges of competing in the postseason and what the team can learn from those final matchups?"

Coach: "The postseason is a different beast, and it's a testament to the team that we were there to compete. Those last two games were a great experience for our younger players, and they gave us a clear picture of the level we need to be at to win a championship. We have a lot to be excited about, and we're already looking forward to the future."
